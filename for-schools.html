            <p class="white-copy-bold">Since 2005, primary schools around the UK have been choosing P’zazz to provide the most inspirational and exciting range of performance and creative clubs. 
<br><br>
The enjoyment and development of each child are at the heart of everything we do, we work with every school to tailor and deliver a range of activities designed to build confidence and self-esteem - with fun guaranteed!
<br><br>
Our inclusive and nurturing approach goes hand-in-hand with our famously professional service. We offer flexible options with regards to club choice, costs and administration – ensuring your clubs are run in the way that best suits your school and its families. 
<br><br>
Every club welcomes every child. We are always happy to discuss any particular needs and work hard to remove any obstacles to participation!</p>

<h3 class="sub-title">What clubs can P-zazz offer?</h3>

<p class="white-copy-bold">We run an ever-growing range of music, art, and performing clubs, all of which are geared up to equip children with new skills. We’ll encourage every child to explore and stretch their own abilities and take risks in a safe and supportive environment. 
<br><br>
Every term new clubs are initiated – usually at the request of the school – so we look forward to hearing your ideas!</p>

<h3 class="sub-title">Explore our current range of <span class="no-wrap">P-zazz</span> Clubs</h3>

<p class="white-copy-bold"><span>Who runs the Clubs?</span><br>
P-zazz clubs are run by Leaders and it is these carefully selected people who make P-zazz clubs great. Unlike some club providers, we recruit experienced, talented people and expect the very best from them.
<br><br>
A rigorous recruitment procedure, thorough training, strict follow-up and on-going support combine to produce the inspirational P-zazz leaders that all children deserve.</p>

<h3 class="sub-title">Getting Started</h3>
<p class="white-copy-bold"><span>Choose your clubs</span><br>
To help you choose between clubs we offer a brief taster assembly, where the Club Leader will give the staff, children and parents a flavour of your selection of clubs.
<br><br>
We usually find that there’s plenty of participation and no doubt left that a P-zazz club equals learning PLUS lots of fun and laughter!
<br><br>
<span>Choose times and days</span><br>
Once you have chosen the club or clubs you’d like us to run, let us know which day or days (Monday to Friday) work too. 
<br><br>
P-zazz can run combinations of two 30 minute clubs (during lunchtimes) and / or one 60 minute club after school.</p>

<h3 class="sub-title">Payment and Paperwork</h3>

<p class="white-copy-bold"><span>Which cost, payment and administration option suits your school?</span><br>
We know that administrative capacity; pupil numbers and appropriate pricing vary so we offer 4 options:
<br><br>
<span>1. Let P-zazz take the strain</span><br>
We will handle ALL administrative work and payments. P-zazz will produce all parent literature and take care of everything around bookings, registration and payments. Parents pay P-zazz directly
<br><br>
<span>2. P-zazz takes the strain, you set the price</span><br>
Again, P- zazz will handle ALL administrative work and payments but we build in the flexibility for you to subsidise the cost of the clubs at a level you choose. The school contributes the subsidy amount per child per club session, parents pay the balance. Parents pay P-zazz directly. 
<br><br>
<span>3. The School handles all administration</span><br>
If you have capacity to take on the extra work, we’ll reflect that in our costs. The school will produce all parent literature and take care of everything around bookings, registration and payments. Parents pay the school.
<br><br>
<span>4. Complete flexibility on costs and numbers</span><br>
The school simply pays P-zazz an hourly rate. This allows numbers of participants to be variable and costs to be entirely governed by the school.
<br><br>

<h3 class="sub-title">THE SERVICE YOU CAN EXPECT - FRIENDLY, FLEXIBLE, EFFICIENT</h3>

<p class="white-copy-bold">Our reputation for providing exemplary service is one of our proudest assets. We will always do whatever possible to contribute positively to the relationship between school, children and parents. 
<br><br>
<span>Attendance</span><br>
We know the importance of attendance and encourage children to value the club and the opportunity it represents. We also reinforce a sense of commitment to the group through plenty of teamwork alongside individual responsibility.  
<br><br>
Our attendance records are meticulous. If a child does not attend one week, Leaders will make a special effort to find them the following week. Two or more consecutive sessions missed? We’ll contact the parents to clarify next steps.
<br><br>
<span>Behaviour</span><br>
Excellent practice in behaviour management is key to the success of our clubs and to the children’s enjoyment. For that reason, it’s also key in every leader’s training and support.<br>
We have simple rules that are clearly communicated to every child and we’ll strive to overcome every challenge.</p>

<span>Cancellation or Absence </span><br> 
Over 99% of our clubs go ahead on time, thanks to our committed staff and unmatched cover arrangements.  If your usual leader is unable to attend a session we’ll try out utmost to provide a replacement leader who’ll arrive with CRB/DBS and photo ID in hand.
<br><br>
If ever we have to cancel we’ll give as much notice as possible and contact parents immediately. Of course, we’ll refund any missed sessions. 
<br><br>
If the school has to cancel or move a session, please let us know as early as possible - we’ll work to fit around your needs. 
<br><br>
<span>Refunds & Credits</span><br>
We are very proud of the fact that children love coming to P-zazz clubs. However, there are always exceptions!
<br><br>
To withdraw a child from a club we'll need 2 weeks notice from the parent. We'll happily refund any remaining sessions. 
<br><br>
Refunds and credits are administered at the end of term, by email. For amounts smaller than £5, we’ll offer the option to donate to your school fund.
<br><br>
<span>Insurance</span><br>
P’zazz are fully insured for public and employer liability.  We’ll provide a copy of our insurance certificate.
