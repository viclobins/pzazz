<br />
We pride ourselves on bringing the pleasure and therapeutic power of music to elderly people not just as entertainment but as reminiscence therapy and as a way to combat dementia, Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other challenges of old age.<br />
<br />
Everyone dreams of having a full and active old age, in a safe, joyful environment. Almost five years of work within residential and care homes have given P-zazz a genuine understanding of the challenges facing professionals trying daily to fulfil these dreams.</span></span></p>

<hr />
<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span class="text-class-12">P-zazz was started by Esther Boughton, Managing Director, in 2005.&nbsp;She put her experience of directing choirs to the test in her local primary school, devising an exciting way of singing which energised the children, giving them passion for music. </span><span class="text-class-12">She began by singing in the classroom and launched P-zazz as a singing club for the rest of the school the following term. Over 70 children signed up (25% of the school) which firmly answered the question of whether there was demand!</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span class="text-class-12"><img alt="" src="/ekmps/shops/estherboughton/resources/Design/esther-in-pz-tshirt-nov14-low-res.jpg" style="float: left; width: 150px; height: 225px;" />In 2008, Esther took P-zazz to other schools and the style of club</span><span class="text-class-12"> was so well rece</span><span class="text-class-12">ived </span><span class="text-class-12">that s</span><span class="text-class-12">he started to recruit P-zazz Leaders, training &amp; suppo</span><span class="text-class-12">rting</span><span class="text-class-12"> the</span><span class="text-class-12">m </span><span class="text-class-12">to deliver excellent sessions across the UK. As it grew, the company diversified to build the portfolio of clubs it now offers, always focussing on the expertise of the Leaders and their ability to communicate those skills in a way which the group members love.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#000000;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span class="text-class-12">The successful growth of P-zazz has been due also to Esther&#39;s background in business. Her 12 years as a Bank Manager have influenced the way the company has developed and prestigious nominations have followed as a result.</span></span><img alt="" height="113" src="/ekmps/shops/estherboughton/resources/Design/entrepreneur-of-the-year-finalist.gif" style="float: right" width="85" /></span></p>
