<h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(75, 0, 130);">Why P-zazz Gold?</span></span></span></h2>

<div><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">P-zazz Gold Sessions bring specially trained, music professionals into residential and care homes, providing top-quality live music and song.<br />
<br />
We pride ourselves on bringing the pleasure and therapeutic power of music to elderly people. Our Gold Sessions are not only entertainment but also reminiscence therapy and an effective way to combat dementia, Alzheimer&rsquo;s and other challenges of ageing.<br />
<br />
Everyone dreams of having a full and active old age, in a safe, joyful environment. Almost five years of work within residential and care homes have given P-zazz a genuine understanding of the issues facing professionals trying daily to fulfil these dreams.</span></span></div>

<h2><span style="font-size:16px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color: rgb(75, 0, 130);">What&rsquo;s best for your residents?</span></span></span></h2>

<div><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">The huge, positive impact of music and song is well proven in both scientific and therapeutic fields. Whether residents are receiving convalescent, palliative or respite care and regardless of physical and mental capacities, P-zazz can offer flexible session content to session content to satisfy all tastes, interests and abilities.<br />
<br />
Our musicians bring with them a wealth of skills, often extending beyond song into dance, drama and the arts. We welcome requests and ideas to stimulate and enhance the lives of your residents.</span></span></div>

<h2><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;"><span style="color:#4B0082;"><span style="font-size: 16px;">What is a P-zazz Gold Session?</span></span></span></span></h2>

<div><span style="font-size:12px;"><span style="font-family: verdana,geneva,sans-serif;">A Gold Session is one hour of exceptional, live music. Our musicians are trained to encourage the group and make the time both entertaining and rewarding.<br />
<br />
A skilled P-zazz musician will sing and lead the singing of residents and visitors. They&rsquo;ll play their own instrument, your piano (if you have one) or use a backing-track &ndash; no need for anything to be provided.<br />
<br />
Our most popular sessions currently consist of a range of songs from the musicals, popular culture, wartime favourites, plus folk and seasonal tunes.<br />
<br />
We aim to be as inclusive as possible and always bring along large-print song-sheets. Keeping safety our priority, we&lsquo;ll encourage the group to extend their mental and physical capacities &ndash; to listen, sing or clap along or get up and dance!<br />
<br />
All P-zazz Leaders are DBS vetted - for your peace of mind.</span></span></div>
