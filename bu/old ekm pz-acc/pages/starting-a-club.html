<hr /></div>

<div align="right"></div>

<p>We are very experienced at starting clubs in primary schools and make it as easy as possible. Recognising that schools are busy places, we do everything we can to make the introduction of a P-zazz club a pleasure.</p>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px">Join in the Experience: Taster Assembly</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 80px">We offer schools a <span style="color: #696969"><strong>free Taster Assembly</strong></span>, where one or more of our Leaders come into an assembly for about 10 minutes to give the children a taste of what being in a P-zazz club is like. The children love the opportunity to meet the Leader and to take part in the activities.</p>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px">No Hassle: A Choice of Payment / Administration Options</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 80px">There is a choice of <span style="color: #696969"><strong>4 options</strong></span> to make our clubs <span style="color: #696969"><strong>accessible</strong></span> for schools in all demographic areas. Please click here for more information - we are always happy to work with you to make our clubs accessible for as many of your children as possible.</p>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px">Fair Access: 2 P&#39;zazz Funded Places</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 80px">In clubs where the parents pay directly and we do all of the administration, we will offer 2 free places for each club we run. We ask you to allocate those places and we&#39;ll do the rest.</p>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px">Information You Need: Policies, Insurances &amp; References</h4>

<div style="margin-left: 80px">Please <a href="http://ekmpowershop14.com/ekmps/shops/estherboughton/policies--insurance-21-w.asp"><span style="color: #0000cd">click here to go to details of our Policies and Insurances</span></a>.<br />
We recognise that it&#39;s very important for you to feel comfortable with us and are very happy to provide contact details of schools where we are already running clubs so you can take references if you wish.</div>
