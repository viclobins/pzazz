<span class="text-class-3">P-zazz was started in primary schools and the whole model has been created with the needs of schools at the forefront. We are proud of our reputation for offering <span style="color: #696969"><strong>great clubs</strong></span> which are <span style="color: #696969"><strong>superbly administered</strong></span>. We recognise how busy school offices are so have tailored everything we do to maximise the service we give school staff. </span>

<h4 style="text-align: left">Club Administration</h4>

<ul>
	<li style="text-align: left">We felt so strongly about getting the administration of the clubs right <img alt="" height="151" src="/ekmps/shops/estherboughton/resources/Design/innovation-through-technology-finalist.jpg" style="float: right" width="110" />every time that we commissioned our own database.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left">This allows us to ensure that schools where our clubs are run receive <span style="color: #696969"><strong>up-to-the-minute information</strong></span> about the children enrolled.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left">We can therefore administer our clubs to a <span style="color: #696969"><strong>very high standard</strong></span>, second to none.</li>
	<li style="text-align: left">We were delighted that our database was nominated for the acclaimed Inspiring Herts <span style="color: #696969"><strong>Innovation in Technology Award</strong></span> 2012.</li>
