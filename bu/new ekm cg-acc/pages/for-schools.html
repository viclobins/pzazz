P-zazz clubs are run by Leaders and it is these carefully selected people who make P-zazz clubs great. Unlike some club providers, we recruit experienced, talented people and expect the very best from them.<br />
<br />
A rigorous recruitment procedure, thorough training, strict follow-up and on-going support combine to produce the inspirational P-zazz leaders that all children deserve.';

To help you choose between clubs we offer a brief taster assembly, where the Club Leader will give the staff, children and parents a flavour of your selection of clubs.<br />

We usually find that there&rsquo;s plenty of participation and no doubt left that a P-zazz club equals learning PLUS lots of fun and laughter!<br />
<br />
<span>Choose times and days</span><br />
Once you have chosen the club or clubs you&rsquo;d like us to run, let us know which day or days (Monday to Friday) work too.<br />
<br />
P-zazz can run combinations of two 30 minute clubs (during lunchtimes) and / or one 60 minute club after school.';

    output_default='<span>Which cost, payment and administration option suits your school?</span><br />
We know that administrative capacity; pupil numbers and appropriate pricing vary so we offer 4 options:<br />
<br />
<span>1. Let P-zazz take the strain</span><br />
We will handle ALL administrative work and payments. P-zazz will produce all parent literature and take care of everything around bookings, registration and payments. Parents pay P-zazz directly<br />
<br />
<span>2. P-zazz takes the strain, you set the price</span><br />
Again, P- zazz will handle ALL administrative work and payments but we build in the flexibility for you to subsidise the cost of the clubs at a level you choose. The school contributes the subsidy amount per child per club session, parents pay the balance. Parents pay P-zazz directly.<br />
<br />
<span>3. The School handles all administration</span><br />
If you have capacity to take on the extra work, we&rsquo;ll reflect that in our costs. The school will produce all parent literature and take care of everything around bookings, registration and payments. Parents pay the school.<br />
<br />
<span>4. Complete flexibility on costs and numbers</span><br />
The school simply pays P-zazz an hourly rate. This allows numbers of participants to be variable and costs to be entirely governed by the school.<br />
<br />

    output_default='Our reputation for providing exemplary service is one of our proudest assets. We will always do whatever possible to contribute positively to the relationship between school, children and parents.<br />
<br />
<span>Attendance</span><br />
We know the importance of attendance and encourage children to value the club and the opportunity it represents. We also reinforce a sense of commitment to the group through plenty of teamwork alongside individual responsibility.<br />
<br />
Our attendance records are meticulous. If a child does not attend one week, Leaders will make a special effort to find them the following week. Two or more consecutive sessions missed? We&rsquo;ll contact the parents to clarify next steps.<br />
<br />
<span>Behaviour</span><br />
Excellent practice in behaviour management is key to the success of our clubs and to the children&rsquo;s enjoyment. For that reason, it&rsquo;s also key in every leader&rsquo;s training and support.<br />
We have simple rules that are clearly communicated to every child and we&rsquo;ll strive to overcome every challenge.';

<span>Cancellation or Absence </span><br />
Over 99% of our clubs go ahead on time, thanks to our committed staff and unmatched cover arrangements. If your usual leader is unable to attend a session we&rsquo;ll try out utmost to provide a replacement leader who&rsquo;ll arrive with CRB/DBS and photo ID in hand.<br />
<br />
If ever we have to cancel we&rsquo;ll give as much notice as possible and contact parents immediately. Of course, we&rsquo;ll refund any missed sessions.<br />
<br />
If the school has to cancel or move a session, please let us know as early as possible - we&rsquo;ll work to fit around your needs.<br />
<br />
<span>Refunds &amp; Credits</span><br />
We are very proud of the fact that children love coming to P-zazz clubs. However, there are always exceptions!<br />
<br />
To withdraw a child from a club we&#39;ll need 2 weeks notice from the parent. We&#39;ll happily refund any remaining sessions.<br />
<br />
Refunds and credits are administered at the end of term, by email. For amounts smaller than &pound;5, we&rsquo;ll offer the option to donate to your school fund.<br />
<br />
<span>Insurance</span><br />
P&rsquo;zazz are fully insured for public and employer liability. We&rsquo;ll provide a copy of our insurance certificate.';
