<br />
<span>Why Performing &amp; Creative Arts?</span><br />
Musical theatre has been my absolute passion since I first performed in Hair at the Old Vic theatre, London 22 years ago. I&rsquo;ve been very fortunate to have made a wonderful living from music and theatre ever since, performing in a wide range of amazing productions. My love of performing has been lifelong but if I had to choose, I&rsquo;d say the highlight so far has been my 2 years in the West End with Les Misérables. When it came to my career I knew that even if I left the stage, staying in drama was a must.<br />
<br />
<span>What makes a good performing arts club?</span><br />
The teaching!<br />
<br />
When I was at school, my drama club was the absolute highlight of my week. I was lucky enough to have great teachers who endlessly told me &lsquo;You can do it!&rsquo; and, guess what? I could! Drama gave me confidence for life and THAT CONFIDENCE is what I want to awaken and nurture in every child attending one of my P-zazz clubs.<br />
<br />
<span>What attracted you to P-zazz?</span><br />
I think P-zazz have a genuinely innovative approach to drama and music. I know from experience, with my own children, that there are many drama and music clubs but the quality and teaching is very variable. I think children deserve the best and I know that the content of the P-zazz sessions and quality of the P-zazz brand are just that &ndash; the best!<br />
<br />
<span>Biggest challenges ahead?</span><br />
The business side isn&rsquo;t something I have any experience in, so I think that&rsquo;ll be tough at first. Because I was concerned about that, I looked for the franchisor who would give me the best business support. That was P-zazz.<br />
<br />
I&rsquo;m receiving a huge amount of training and on-going support. Marketing, finance and all of the IT you need is included in the initial training. Plus, I know they already have successful franchisees with and without business experience.<br />
<br />
<span>What are you most looking forward to as a P-zazz franchisee?</span><br />
I have 8 year old twins who adore music and &ndash; like most children - have a wonderful ability to express themselves. I want to have the opportunity to share my passion and skills with children and to pass on the excitement that I feel about the performing arts.<br />
<br />
It&rsquo;s my dream to work with groups of children and watch each child really grow and blossom!<br />
<br />
Working in the care sector is also something I&rsquo;m looking forward to embracing. I think it&rsquo;s a great extra dimension to the P-zazz business model &ndash; it&rsquo;s a privilege to be able to work with older and vulnerable people.<br />
<br />
On a more practical note, of course a P-zazz franchise will give me the perfect opportunity to build a business around the needs and timetables of my family. Controlling when, where and with whom I work &ndash; well, that&rsquo;s never happened before!<br />
<br />
I can&rsquo;t wait to get stuck in!';
