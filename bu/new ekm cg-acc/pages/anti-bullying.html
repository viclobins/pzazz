We also appreciate the huge pressure on schools to support victims, bullies and often the families, on both sides.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We are very proud to offer bespoke&nbsp;<span>Anti-Bullying Workshops</span>&nbsp;to educate the children in your care about bullying - recognising, coping with, preventing and reporting it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We will be happy to incorporate elements of your school&#39;s behaviour and anti-bullying policies and to tailor our Workshops towards issues particular to your school, demographic or area.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
P-zazz&nbsp;<span>Anti-Bullying Workshops</span>&nbsp;do not require special props or space. They are usually run on a class-by class basis - as the content is age-specific - and can be organised as a single day or separate sessions.';
